config.nvim

   Simple configuration for neovim with (optional) LSP support. Built
   by plucking options out of my .vimrc [VIMRC] when a default behavior
   bothered me.

   Here be no icons, text rules.

Basic Installation

   $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/caio/config.nvim ~/.config/nvim

Starting/Using LSP

   It's not always that I want to boot heavy IDE-like features when I
   open a file with the editor, so lsp functionality is gated behind
   the LspStart command. Issuing it will launch a server and configure
   mappings accordingly.

   :LspStart
