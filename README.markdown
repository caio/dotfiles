What is this?
=============

This is an aggregation of every publishable configuration file used by Caio Rom√£o. These configuration files are generally called 'dotfiles' and that's the reason for this project's name.

Notes
=====

Some of these configuration files (which are generally called 'dotfiles') were assembled from different and untracked sources. If you own any piece of code which I haven't credited, please send me a note and I'll gladly give credit where it's due.

License
=======

Unless stated otherwise, you're free to copy, modify and distribute anything here that was ''created by me''.

As stated before, some of the content come from untracked sources and I can't (and won't) be responsible for it's licensing, so if you're going to use anything here for non-GPLed projects, please send me a note ''or'' use google to see if someone owns a pice of it.
